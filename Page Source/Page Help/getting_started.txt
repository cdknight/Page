Welcome to Page!
Page is an open-source, free slide presentation software built in the command line!
Let's learn how to use Page.

To start, let's write the "Hello, World!" program in Page.

To do this, create a new file called hellopage.pg, and

write this:

Hello, World!

Then, you can run it with a Page object in python, or
(in the near future), the page program with args hellopage.pg

Let's learn how to change the background(in Windows)

write this to helloworld.pg:

@color 3e
Hello, World!

This uses the system command "color" to set the background, and then run it.

Using system commands:

To do a system command, simply write @ followed by the command to have it print to Page.

Page commmands:

Page commands always start with "<".

Then, followed by the command, then /, then the args

Commands:
"inp" - waits for user to input something to the presentation, can be used as text transition
"bar" - creates a string of _'s to create a "bar-like" feel as a separator
"npg" - create a new page within the file

Args -
If you don't want args, please have args set to '0' or else Page will give an error.

Enjoy Page!
